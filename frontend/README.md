### Description

This app is to going to a maximum of 5 API's, using node.js, express, mongoDB and React.
It is intented to using react as means to remove the need to load a different page.
Users will have the ability to choose which API they would like to display.

### Issues and Errors

Many!!
I first attempted this project by following a tutorial but I ultimately was quite understanding what the tutorial was doing and I decided to restart this project from scratch.

My first error was trying to get the Cat facts API to diplay a fact at random, I learned that I can't use math.random and pass a variable that is not a number, as one of its parameters
Instead, (with help) I used math.random to create a random number and pass that as the index.

Second error, trying to access the object of the getQuotes API, but the object doesn't have a name. Console log just returns "undefined" and it is being right prick about it. So the solution was actually very simple, adding insult to injury, I did not need to loop through the object 




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
